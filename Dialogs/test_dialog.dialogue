A trashcan full of teared up paper. Constraints of alternative shifts makes its owner a complete stranger to you but eagerness still rings inside your head.
You whisper to yourself : "Maybe I should use mine a little bot more".
- Search
	You uneasily rummage through your coworker's belongings but find nothing.
	- Continue Searching
		Your muscles stiffen and your breath shortens as you reluctantly reach inside the bin. You somehow feel forced to do so.
		- Continue Searching
			do GameManager.start_alert()
			As you reach for the bin once more anxiousness surges through your body, each breath piercing your chest and numbing your limbs.
			You manage find a teared up newspaper sheet stuck to the bottom of the can.
			- Grab
				Covered in stains and wrinkles, the paper almosts collapses as you bring it to your face.
				You could only manage to decipher a few specks before it fell appart :
				"[...] is over [...] the last [...] down [...]"
				This feels meaningless.
